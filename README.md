Selected US Stock Price Movement and Forecasting
---

In this demostation we have used Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) share price between 2019 to 2022. The raw data is obtained through web scrapping using Python programming.

Then, the data is used as an input to Power BI Desktop to visualize the share price movement. 

All the share price faced a deep decreased due to the surge of Covid-19 cases in the USA. However, all the share price climped up generally due to market sentiment that IT companies with fundamentally strong will not badly affect from the Covid-19 cases and government policy. 

I also use the forecasting function from the Power BI Desktop to predict the share price performance in the next 11 months (i.e until December 2022). The predicted share price (the shaded area)is in upward trend for all the selected IT companies.
